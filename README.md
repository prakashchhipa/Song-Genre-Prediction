# Song-Genre-Prediction

Predicting the genre of songs for given song ids. User song listening activity history and song duration related data is provided for learning.

**Provided Problem Statement:**

Predict the genre of some tracks with following available data:
session.csv: This file contains records of various user session listening specific tracks of their choice at different point of time. More specifically each record has set of three field user_id, song_id and timestamp.   

tracks.csv: It has records of different tracks with their time duration and genre. Each record consists of three field song_id, duration and genre respectively.
 
tracks_to_complete.csv: This file contains test data having song_id for which genre needs to be predicted.

**Execution Environment & Required Library:**

1) Python 2.x
2) Libraries
   - Scikit Learn
   - Numpy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
 
**Solution:** 

1) solution.py - Development code for data preprocesing, feature engineering to create worthful fetures, ML modeling and finally validation and results.
2) solution.pdf - Transforms problem statements to approach it effectively, then explains all mandatory steps and possible reasoning behind feature engineerings & model selection. explains further results and justifies the model performance.


**Note for other Enthusiastic Contributor:**

Most welcome to extend & contribute this experiment with better feature engineering & ML modeling.
